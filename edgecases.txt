If you do these:
  yeet -> eetyay
  exit -> exityay

An algorithm wouldn't know how to convert them back:
  eetyay -> eet / yeet
  exityay -> exit / yexit

Even outside of the edge cases where a word starts with y, there are more problems:
  thanks -> anksthay
  anksthay -> thanks / sthank / ksthan / nkstha

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no way to tell what used to be the start of the word, and what used to be the end, once it's been turned into pig latin.
